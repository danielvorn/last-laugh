# Last Laugh

Reddit client app featuring top 20 posts from r/ProgrammerHumor

# Reflection

This challenge took me about 5 hours to complete. The hardest part was figuring out how to use the Reddit API. Once I figured that out, the rest was smooth sailing. I decided to represent Reddit posts as horizontally-centered containers. Because Reddit scores can vary in size, I decided to abbreviate the numbers (ie 23038 => 23.0k). To give my design a little more flare, I threw in some icons to accompany the text.
